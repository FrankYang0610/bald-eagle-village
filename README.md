## The story
The story takes place in a remote village in the mountains of Alaska. At dawn, with fog filling the air, two bald eagles fly side by side as they visit the village. As the fog clears, the two eagles notice each other and begin a chase above the village. The chase is thrilling! The eagles weave up and down, sometimes soaring upward, sometimes diving, sometimes flapping steadily, and sometimes making sudden directional changes that catch the other off guard. The sun rises, daylight arrives, and after tiring themselves out, the two bald eagles fly away side by side.
